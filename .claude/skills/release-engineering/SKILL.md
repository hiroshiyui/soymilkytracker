When performing release engineering, always follow these steps:

1. **Verify the build is clean** — run the project's standard build command from a clean state to confirm everything compiles and passes CI checks before tagging.

2. **Determine the release type** — review all unreleased commits since the last tag and classify the release as `major`, `minor`, or `patch` following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Present the recommendation to the user and confirm before proceeding.

3. **Update the version** — bump the version in the project's version manifest(s) (e.g. `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, or equivalent) to match the new release version.

4. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** — add a new version entry at the top following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format. Group changes under `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, or `Security` as appropriate. Include all notable changes since the previous release.

5. **Commit the release** — stage the version manifest(s) and `CHANGELOG.md` together and commit with the message `chore: release vX.Y.Z`.

6. **Tag the release** — create an annotated Git tag (e.g., `git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "v1.2.3"`) and push both the commit and the tag to the remote (`git push && git push --tags`).

7. **Create a GitHub release** — use `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "..."` with the corresponding `CHANGELOG.md` section as the release notes. Note: use `--notes` (not `--body`) for the release description.
